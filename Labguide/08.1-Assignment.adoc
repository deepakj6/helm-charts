In this lab we will look into an existing brown field pages microservice and deploy it to the K8s cluster.

== Learning Outcomes
After completing the lab, you will be able to understand

. Deployment Architecture
. Design for deployment
. Deploy 2 tier application

== Develop the pages microservice

.  Docker image of pages microservice is available in the image registry. We will be focusing on designing the deployment architecture.
.  It is necessary to understand the configuration requirements and dependecies, if any, in order for the application to work properly once deployed.
. Let us examine the deployment architecture. The microservice is composed of a 2 tier architecture.
 In order to complete the design:
.. We will have to design the db tier and service tier
.. Look at the dependecies and figure out a way to connect the database tier with the service tier
